# Account Disabler

### How Does It Work?
It sends friend requests to people through requests and after about 2 friend requests the account gets disabled or phone locked. I tested this earlier and my account got disabled within less than a minute, I wasn't timing as it was unintentional. This method can be used to lock people out their accounts to annoy them or just to be a cunt, your choice.
### Usage
1. Download all the files and make sure they are all in the same folder.
2. Open up the **.env** and put the token you want to disable/lock in it.
3. Put some users in the **users.txt** file, they can be random user names of anyone.
4. Now run the **disable.py** using the terminal, for example: **python disable.py**.
5. When you are ready just press enter as prompted to and it should start saying **Username#1336 Added!**.
6. After about 2-4 accounts, you should be locked out of the account/disabled.
